# Momentum Clone Application

The idea behind this project was to try and create a minimalist clone of Momentum Chrome Extension. The application uses localStorage to store data and modify DOM elements.
All you have to do is input your name in the input box and enter the most important task of the day and press 'Enter'. Once that is done, the app will remember your inputs and they will still be displayed even if you refresh the page.
To make the task as completed, click on the empty square on the left.
To delete the task, click on the 'X' button on the right.
To update the name or the task, double click on the text.
